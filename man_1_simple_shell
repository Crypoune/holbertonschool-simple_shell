.TH HSH 1 "6 January 2026" "Holberton School" "Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimal command line interpreter that reads commands from standard input
and executes them using system calls.

The shell supports interactive and non-interactive modes and is designed as
an educational reimplementation of basic UNIX shell behavior.

It does not implement advanced features such as pipes, redirections, or job
control.

.SH MODES OF OPERATION
.TP
.B Interactive mode
When standard input is connected to a terminal,
.B hsh
displays a prompt and waits for user input.
Each command is executed before the prompt is shown again.
.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
When input is provided via a pipe or file,
.B hsh
reads and executes commands line by line without displaying a prompt.

.SH COMMAND PROCESSING
For each command line,
.B hsh
performs the following steps:
.IP 1. 3
Reads a line from standard input using \fBgetline\fR.
.IP 2. 3
Parses the line into arguments using whitespace delimiters.
.IP 3. 3
Checks if the command is a built-in command.
.IP 4. 3
Searches for the executable:
.RS
- If the command contains a slash (/), it is treated as a path  
- Otherwise, it is searched in directories listed in the \fBPATH\fR variable
.RE
.IP 5. 3
If found, creates a child process using \fBfork\fR.
.IP 6. 3
Executes the command with \fBexecve\fR and waits for completion.

If the command cannot be found, no child process is created.

.SH PATH HANDLING
.B hsh
retrieves the \fBPATH\fR environment variable using a custom implementation
of \fB_getenv\fR.
Each directory in PATH is tested to locate an executable file with execute
permissions.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution.
.TP
.B 126
Permission denied.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Start the shell interactively:
.B
.nf
$ ./hsh
$
.fi
.TP
Execute a command found in PATH:
.B
.nf
$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  123 main.c
.fi
.TP
Execute a command using an absolute path:
.B
.nf
$ /bin/pwd
/home/user/project
.fi

.SH LIMITATIONS
- No pipes or redirections
- No wildcard expansion
- No command chaining
- No job control
